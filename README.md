# Uber Trip Data Dimensional Modeling

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a dimensional model for Uber trip data to facilitate efficient analysis and reporting. The dimensional model includes a fact table and several dimension tables to organize and relate various aspects of Uber trips.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the application of dimensional modeling concepts using Python and pandas, along with data visualization using Lucidchart for designing the dimensional model.

## Project Structure
- **Data Source:** Uber trip data stored in a CSV file (`uber_data.csv`).
- **Code Files:**
  - `dimensional_modeling.py`: Python script for data preprocessing, creating dimension tables, and generating the fact table.
- **Output:**
  - `fact_table.csv`: CSV file containing the fact table with consolidated trip data.
- **Documentation:**
  - `README.md` (this file): Overview, project structure, and instructions.

## Tools Used
- Python (programming language)
- pandas (Python library for data manipulation)
- Lucidchart (online tool for designing the dimensional model)

## Instructions
1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/uber-trip-data-dimension-model.git
